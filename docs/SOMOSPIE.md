SOil MOisture SPatial Inference Engine (SOMOSPIE) is a data-driven tool designed to improve the representation of soil moisture. It addresses the limitations of remote sensing (i.e., satellites), such as coarse resolution and spatial gaps, through various machine learning algorithms based on meaningful terrain features.

SOMOSPIE supports reproducibility, explainability, and portability of results, contributing to FAIR principles. Its use of containerization and methods usable with publicly available datasets allows users to use and experiment with SOMOSPIE easily.
